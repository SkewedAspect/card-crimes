# Card Crimes ToDo list:

* ~~Add support for detecting when a player has disconnected, and have them automatically leave the game.~~
* If the creator leaves the game, promote another human player to 'creator' status.
    * We'll need to have a message for 'you are now the creator'.
* We need to ensure that only the creator is able to add/remove bots, add cards.
